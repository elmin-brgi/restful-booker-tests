# There are 3 bugs discovered on Endpoint with date parameters.
# All of these bugs can be demonstrated manually and are described in DISCOVERED_BUGS.md 
# However since the Endpoint is returning only ids it would be a waste of time and resources to sent get booking request for every id returned to check if dates are
# greater than or equal to the passed ones in endpont. 
# If the issues are resolved, these tests can be updated to reflect the correct behavior.
